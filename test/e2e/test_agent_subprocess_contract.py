"""`dl <ws> -- <command>` as a program sees it: pipes on every stream, no terminal.

`test_interactive_session.py` already runs one-shot commands through this workspace
and already asserts that a failing one comes back non-zero. It does all of it on a
**pty**, because that is the transport a developer gets, and dl reaches the container
two different ways depending on which it is: an OpenSSH invocation carrying `-F` for
the pty path, and `devpod ssh --command` for the piped one. So none of those
assertions cover the shape a script runs in, and the shape a script runs in is the one
`docs/agents-using-dl.md` publishes a contract about.

Hence a second file rather than four more cases over there. Everything here runs with
stdout, stderr and stdin as pipes, which is what `subprocess.run(capture_output=True)`
gives and what an agent harness gives, and each test is one clause of the published
contract. `test/test_agent_contract_doc.py` is the other half of the pairing: it holds
the page to still making the claims these tests are the evidence for.

The stderr clause was the interesting one, and until devlaunch passed
`--log-output json` to `devpod ssh` it was a strict `xfail`. See
`test_stderr_is_the_commands_output_verbatim`.
