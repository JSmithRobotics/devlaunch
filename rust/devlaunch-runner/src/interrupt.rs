//! Async-signal-safe cleanup for a `dl` that is killed mid-flight.
//!
//! `dl`'s disposition for SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGHUP alike is `_exit(128 +
//! signo)` — 130, 143, 129 — after the cleanup below (see `dl`'s
//! `install_signal_handlers`, which both binaries call from `main`). A signal
//! handler may do almost nothing — not allocate, not lock a mutex, not call a
//! libc function outside the async-signal-safe list — so it cannot run
//! destructors. Python got its cleanup for free, because a `KeyboardInterrupt`
//! *unwinds*: the `with` blocks that staged the GitHub token, wrote the metadata
//! temp and unpacked the tools bundle all ran their `finally`. `_exit` runs
//! none of that, so a Ctrl-C during the minutes-long `devpod up` used to leave
//! the plaintext `GH_TOKEN` file on disk (concurrency review F2/H4/R8) and the
//! `devpod up` child orphaned, still holding the build while `dl` — and the
//! launch lock it released on exit — were already gone (F3).
//!
//! This module is the missing `finally`, expressed as the only things a handler
//! is allowed to do about a file and a child: `unlink(2)`/`rmdir(2)` a path, and
//! `killpg(2)`/`kill(2)` a process group or a single detached child, with
//! `waitpid(2)` and `poll(2)` to give the group's leader a moment to act on its
//! SIGTERM before the SIGKILL. All of them are on POSIX's async-signal-safe list.
//!
//! # The registry is lock-free by construction
//!
//! A handler that took a lock could deadlock against the very thread it
//! interrupted (which may hold that lock), so nothing here locks. The live
//! paths are a fixed-size array of [`AtomicPtr`]; a registration claims a free
//! slot with a single compare-and-swap and a drop releases it with a single
//! store. The handler only ever *reads* the slots and calls the async-signal-safe
//! syscall on each non-null pointer. There is no dynamic structure to walk and
//! no allocator to re-enter.
//!
//! # Why a registration leaks its `CString`
//!
//! The pointer a slot holds is a `CString` handed over by [`CString::into_raw`].
//! A drop nulls the slot but **does not** reclaim it: freeing would race the
//! handler, which may read the slot on another thread and then `unlink` freed
//! memory, and a handler cannot take the lock that would make that safe. The
//! leak it trades for is bounded and cheap — a handful of short-lived paths in a
//! process that is about to exit — and a pointer the handler reads in the window
//! between a drop's slot-null and "not yet reached" names a random tempfile that
//! the ordinary drop has already removed, so the `unlink`/`rmdir` is a harmless
//! `ENOENT`. Correctness of the credential cleanup is worth a few dozen leaked
//! bytes.
