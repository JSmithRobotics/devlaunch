//! Whether the Claude agent that locked a worktree is still running.
//!
//! # The one lock that can be proved stale
//!
//! Claude Code locks every worktree it makes for a subagent, with a reason of
//! its own shape: `claude agent <id> (pid <N> start <T>)`. `N` is the agent
//! process's pid and `T` its start time, both as the process saw them. Read out
//! of Claude Code 2.1.289's own source: on Linux `T` is field 22 of
//! `/proc/<N>/stat`, the start time in clock ticks since boot. Claude Code
//! reads the same two numbers back to decide whether a lock it finds is stale,
//! and this module asks the same question.
//!
//! A pid alone proves nothing, because pids are reused and because a pid is a
//! number in one pid namespace. So the answer is "gone" only when **every**
//! namespace that could have written the lock says the process is gone:
//!
//! - **Which namespaces.** The one this pass runs in, when the path git
//!   recorded resolves here to the site itself, and only when that namespace is
//!   the whole machine's (see below). And every container whose own mounts put
//!   the recorded path on the site: the mount that covers the path inside the
//!   container is found (the longest destination that is a prefix of it), and
//!   its source, joined with the rest of the path, has to resolve to the site.
//!   A running container whose source is not on this machine any more is asked
//!   by device and inode instead, because a bind mount follows a renamed
//!   directory. A stopped container whose mapping cannot be worked out is
//!   ignored: it has no process to veto with. A recorded path that no namespace
//!   maps to the site is a "could not tell".
//! - **Gone, in one namespace.** A container that is not running (exited,
//!   created, dead) has no processes left. Otherwise the process table is read
//!   (the host's `/proc`, or the container's through `docker exec` as root),
//!   and the agent is still running when any process in it has start time `T`
//!   and pid `N`, either in that namespace or as the innermost of its `NSpid`
//!   entries, which is how a process in a nested container is matched. No such
//!   process is gone. A pid `N` with another start time is a reused pid, and is
//!   gone too.
//! - **The whole machine, first, and always.** A procfs that lists a kernel
//!   thread is the initial pid namespace's, and lists every process on this
//!   kernel with its `NSpid`. The same test runs over all of it before
//!   anything else, so an agent in a namespace the mounts did not map (another
//!   docker, podman, a renamed clone's old path) still stands the site. A pass
//!   that cannot read that table proves nothing gone: `dl` in a pid namespace of
//!   its own (a container or sandbox started without `--pid=host`), `hidepid`,
//!   or an entry that will not read. `dl` in a container started with
//!   `--pid=host` sees the kernel threads and runs the proof. The namespaces
//!   above are still asked after it, and they are not a second opinion that
//!   could be skipped when the table says gone. A container whose runtime gives
//!   it a kernel of its own (Docker Desktop on Linux, colima or lima, kata,
//!   gVisor through `--runtime`) is in no table on this kernel: its own table,
//!   read through `docker exec`, is the only place its agent shows. They are
//!   also what says the lock was written on this machine at all.
//! - **Everything else is "could not tell".** A reason in any other shape, a
//!   docker that is missing, refuses or times out, a mount source this machine
//!   cannot read, a process table that does not list pid 1 (no procfs, or one
//!   mounted with `hidepid`), a host-side lock read from inside a pid namespace,
//!   a line that does not parse, a process with start time `T` whose `NSpid`
//!   could not be read, and a container that is paused or restarting.
//!
//! **What this cannot see.** A writer outside every running container this
//! docker lists that shares the path: a VM that mounts the same home at the
//! same path, an NFS home shared between machines, another machine. Its
//! processes are in no table here. When the site is on a network or shared
//! filesystem (NFS, SMB, 9p, FUSE, Ceph and the like), that is seen, and the
//! answer is "could not tell". Seen from the side that exports it (a host whose
//! home a VM mounts), the filesystem is a local one, and the VM's lock reads as
//! stale. A gVisor or kata container that this docker runs is not one of
//! them: it is asked through `docker exec` like any other. And it assumes the
//! reader and the writer share a time namespace, as docker's containers do:
//! under another one, the start time would read shifted and a live agent as a
//! reused pid.
//!
//! The lock file is never touched here. `dl <ws> rm` removes the whole clone,
//! and a site whose lock is proved stale still has to pass every other question
//! (clean, nothing unpushed) before anything clears.
