//! The prompt editor, and the boot it overlaps.
//!
//! `aid <workspace>` with no prompt on a terminal does not go straight to the
//! agent any more: the workspace starts booting in the background *while* the
//! prompt is typed, so the minute a container takes to come up and the minute a
//! prompt takes to write are the same minute. The prompt is read from the
//! terminal rather than from argv, which is also the end of the shell-quoting
//! problem — nothing the user types here passes through a shell on the host.
//!
//! The boot is a separate **process**, not a thread, and that is the whole
//! design. It is the shape wf's prewarm already takes — a background
//! `dl <workspace> up` beside a foreground launch — so everything that makes two
//! launches of one workspace safe is already built and tested: the per-workspace
//! launch lock serializes them, and the foreground launch finds the container
//! running and fast-attaches. A thread could not do this: `devpod up` inherits
//! the process's stdout and stderr with no seam to intercept them, and the SIGINT
//! disposition `_exit`s the whole process.
//!
//! The child is this same binary re-entered through the internal `--boot-up`
//! argv (aid's one dependency is `dl`, and the one binary aid can find without
//! guessing at PATH is itself). Its output goes to a log file and is replayed to
//! stderr after the prompt is submitted, so the build's progress is seen — just
//! not interleaved with the typing. The child is deliberately left in aid's
//! process group: a terminal Ctrl-C mid-editing reaches both processes, and the
//! child's own interrupt handler (the shared `dl::install_signal_handlers`
//! disposition) kills its `devpod up` group and unlinks its staged token file,
//! so abandoning the editor tears the whole boot down with no new machinery.
//!
//! Every failure in here is a fallback, never an ending: a boot that could not
//! be spawned means the launch runs serially, exactly as it did before this
//! module existed. The feature is an overlap and an editor, not a new way for a
//! launch to fail.
